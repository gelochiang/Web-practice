/*
There are two wildcards often used in conjunction with the like operator :
1. The percent sign(%) represents zero, one, or multiple characters.
2. The underscore sign(_) represents one, single character.

! NOTE : MS Access uses an asterisk(*) instead of the percent sign(%),
         and a question mark(?) insetad of the underscore(_).

The percent sign and the underscore can also be used in combination.

// like syntax :
    select column1,column2,...
    from table_name
    where columnN like pattern;

@ Tip : We can also combine any number of conditions using and/or operators. 

// Here are some examples showing differenet like operators with "%" and "_" wildcards :

like operator          | description
======================================================================================================
where Name like "a%"   | Finds any values that start with "a"
where Name like "%a"   | Finds any values that end with "a"
where Name like "%or"  | Finds any values that have "or" in any position
where Name like "_r%"  | Finds any values that have "r" in second position
where Name like "a_%"  | Finds any values that start with "a" and are at least 2 characters in length
where Name like "a__%" | Finds any values taat start with "a" and are at least 3 characters in length
where Name like "a%o"  | Finds any values that start with "a" and ends with "o"
