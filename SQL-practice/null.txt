We have the table in database name's "Grade"
+-------------------+
Name | Score |School
Gelo | 75    | PCCU
Leo  | 95    | YLSH
Ace  | 90    | NTU
Ann  | 95    | NTU
+-------------------+

// is null example :
select Name,Score,School
from Grade
where is null;
# output :
    No result // Because the table which named "Grade" is not have null
@ Tip : Can Always use 'is null' to look for null values
