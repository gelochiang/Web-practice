We have the table in database name's "Grade"
+-------------------+
Name | Score | School
Gelo | 75    | PCCU
Leo  | 95    | YLSH
Lin  | 100   | NCTU
Ace  | 90    | NTU
Ann  | 95    | NTU
+-------------------+
We have the second table in database name's "Birthday"
+-------------------+
Name | Born
Gelo | 2003/2/18
Leo  | 2004/5/29
Lin  | 2003/7/6
Ace  | 1973/2/10
Ann  | 2013/9/11

// alias example :
select Name as Student, Score as Got
from Grade;
# output :
    Student | Got | School
    Gelo    | 75  | PCCU
    Leo     | 95  | YLSH
    Lin     | 100 | NCTU
    Ace     | 90  | NTU
    Ann     | 95  | NTU

// example2 :
select Name as "Student Name", Score as Got
from Grade;
# output :
    Student Name | Got | School
    Gelo         | 75  | PCCU
    Leo          | 95  | YLSH
    Lin          | 100 | NCTU
    Ace          | 90  | NTU
    Ann          | 95  | NTU
! NOTE : It requires double quotation("") marks or square brackets([])
         if the alias name contains spaces

// conbine as example :
select Name, School+" / Final exam score : "+Score as Got
from Grade;
# output :
    Student | Got
    Gelo    | PCCU / Final exam score : 75
    Leo     | YLSH / Final exam score : 95
    Lin     | NCTU / Final exam score : 100
    Ace     | NTU / Final exam score : 90
    Ann     | NTU / Final exam score : 95

// conbine as example (for My SQL) :
select Name, (School," / Final exam score : ",Score) as Got
from Grade;
# output :
    Student | Got
    Gelo    | PCCU / Final exam score : 75
    Leo     | YLSH / Final exam score : 95
    Lin     | NCTU / Final exam score : 100
    Ace     | NTU / Final exam score : 90
    Ann     | NTU / Final exam score : 95

// Uses the "Grade" and "Birthday" tables, and give them the table aliases of
   "G" and "B" respectively (Here we use aliases to make the SQL shorter) 
   example :
select G.Name, G.School, B.Born
from Grade as G, Birthday as B
where G.Name="Gelo" and G.Name=B.Name;
# output :
    Name | School | Born
    Gleo | PCCU   | 2003/2/18
--------------------------or--------------------------
select Grade.Name, Grade.School, Birthday.Born
from Grade,Birthday
where Grade.Name="Gelo" and Grade.Name=Birthday.Name;
