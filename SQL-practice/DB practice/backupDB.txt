/*
The backup database statement is used in SQL Server to create a full
back up of an existing SQL database.

// backup DB syntax :
backup database DB_name to disk = "FilePath";

A differential back up only backs up the parts of the DB that habe changed
since the last full DB backup.
// backup with differential example :
backup database DB_name to disk "FilePath"
with differential;
*/

/*
// backup DB example :
backup database testDB to disk = "Desktop\Web-practice\SQL-practice";

@ Tip : Always back up the DB to a different drive than the actual DB.
        Then, if you get a disk crash, you will not lose your backup file
        along with the DB.

// backup with differential example :
backup database testDB to disk = "Desktop\Web-practice\SQL-practice"
with differential;

@ Tip : A differential back up reduces the back up time 
        (since only the changes are backed up).
